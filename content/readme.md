1. Date Criteria  
	- In order to use the date input logic correctly a content manager must put the key and acceptance values in with accordance to our encoding
    - We have several options for inputting a date
    - First we put it the comparator into the criteria (no parathensis)
		- (> / < / =)
    - Will check the users date against the given date using the specified comparator
    - Next we will put in the date (no parathensis)
    	- (>11-14-1999)
    - Needs to follow this patteren (>MM-DD-YYYY)
    - For putting in a dynamically calculated date (i.e. the user has to be older than 60 years)
    - We can do this by following a similar pattern (no parathensis)
    	- (>60years)
    - The pattern is the operator then an amount of time then a determiner (months, days, years)
    - You are also able to put in multiple dates / encodings to create a range∂
    - i.e. You wish to only have a user be elgible if they are older than 40 years and less than 60 years
    	- acceptanceValues: ["<60years", ">40years"]
