        This form will guide you through creating a new [user story](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-stories/).

        User stories capture requests and word them in terms of a persona
        who may be making the request, the nature of their request, and
        why the request adds value to the project.

        User stories capture **what** a user wants, not **how** they want
        it done.  They capture goals, not system interactions.

        A good user story is as small as possible as long as it:

          - Describes a user’s goal (what), not a system interaction (how)
          - Is narrow, rather than shallow
          - Is potentially shippable -- it can be experienced, is
            understandable, a user could make use of it
          - Is option-enabling - doesn’t specify implementation details

        We write stories in this way so we can do the work in thin vertical
        slices.  This results in little to no surprises by going through all
        the layers. Rather than trying to do all of the research and then
        all of the design, etc, you do just enough of each layer in order
        to have something tangible that you can demo & build upon.

        Think about what is the simplest path from beginning to end.  It’s
        a basic user path, a happy path.  Think about the type of user
        and what they would want to do.
